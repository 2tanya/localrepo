The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. 
                Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools.
                 Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the formal schooling system.
                  Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal 
                  education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education, 
                  secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, 
                  like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, like science education,
                 language education, and physical education. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The main field investigating education is called education studies. 
                It examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it 
                has, and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education, 
                sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history 
                of education. In prehistory, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation.
                 With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew.
                  This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly 
                  available to elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century
                   made books more widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th 
                   centuries, public education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of making primary
                    education available to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age. </p>
